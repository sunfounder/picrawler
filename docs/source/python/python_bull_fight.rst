After the code runs, the terminal will display the following prompt:

.. code-block::

    No desktop !
    * Serving Flask app "vilib.vilib" (lazy loading)
    * Environment: production
    WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.

**Code**

.. note::
    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to source code path like ``picrawler\examples``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.


.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

    from picrawler import Picrawler
    from time import sleep
    from robot_hat import Music
    from vilib import Vilib
    
    
    crawler = Picrawler() 
    
    music = Music()
    
    def main():
        Vilib.camera_start()
        Vilib.display()
        Vilib.color_detect("red") 
        speed = 80
    
        while True:
            if Vilib.detect_obj_parameter['color_n']!=0:
                coordinate_x = Vilib.detect_obj_parameter['color_x']
                music.sound_play_threading('./sounds/talk1.wav')
    
                if coordinate_x < 100:
                    crawler.do_action('turn left',1,speed)
                    sleep(0.05) 
                elif coordinate_x > 220:
                    crawler.do_action('turn right',1,speed)
                    sleep(0.05) 
                else :
                    crawler.do_action('forward',2,speed)
                    sleep(0.05)    
            else :
                crawler.do_step('stand',speed)
                sleep(0.05)
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()


**How it works?**

In general, this project combines the knowledge points of :ref:`py_move`, :ref:`py_vision` and :ref:`py_sound`.

Its flow is shown in the figure below:
