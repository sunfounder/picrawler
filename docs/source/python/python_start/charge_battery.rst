3. Power Supply for Raspberry Pi (Important)
=====================================================

Charge
-------------------

Insert the battery cable. Next, insert the USB-C cable to charge the battery.
You will need to provide your own charger; we recommend a 5V 3A charger, or your commonly used smartphone charger will suffice.

.. note::
    Connect an external Type-C power source to the Type-C port on the robot hat; it will immediately start charging the battery, and a red indicator light will illuminate.\
    When the battery is fully charged, the red light will automatically turn off.


Power ON
----------------------

Turn on the power switch. The Power indicator light and the battery level indicator light will illuminate.

Wait for a few seconds, and you will hear a slight beep, indicating that the Raspberry Pi has successfully booted.

.. note::
    If both battery level indicator lights are off, please charge the battery.
    When you need extended programming or debugging sessions, you can keep the Raspberry Pi operational by inserting the USB-C cable to charge the battery simultaneously.
