Sound Effect
=====================

In this example, we use PiCrawler's (to be precise, Robot HAT's) sound effects. It consists of three parts, namely **Muisc**, **Sound**, **Text to Speech**.

.. image:: img/tts.png

**Install i2samp**

Before using that functions, first activate the speaker so that it will be enabled and can make sounds.

Run ``i2samp.sh`` in, and this script will install everything needed to use i2s amplifier.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/picrawler/
    sudo bash i2samp.sh 

There will be several prompts asking to confirm the request. Respond to all prompts with a **Y**. After the changes have been made to the Raspberry Pi system, the computer will need to reboot for these changes to take effect.

After rebooting, run the ``i2samp.sh`` script again to test the amplifier. If a sound successfully plays from the speaker, the configuration is complete.


**Run the Code**

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/picrawler/examples
    sudo python3 sound_effect.py

After the code runs, please operate according to the prompt that printed on the terminal.

Input key to call the function!
* ``q``: Play background music
* ``1``: Play sound effect
* ``2``: Play sound effect with threads
* ``t``: Text to speak
* If you want to exit the program, press ``Ctrl+C``.


**Code** 

.. code-block:: python

    '''
        Sorry, currently there is only sound when running with sudo
    '''

    from time import sleep
    from robot_hat import Music,TTS

    music = Music()
    tts = TTS()

    manual = '''
    Input key to call the function!
        q: Play background music
        1: Play sound effect
        2: Play sound effect with threads
        t: Text to speak

        Ctrl^C: quit
    '''

    def main():  
        print(manual)

        flag_bgm = False
        music.music_set_volume(20)
        tts.lang("en-US")


        while True:
            key = input() 
            key = key.lower() 
            if key == "q":
                flag_bgm = not flag_bgm
                if flag_bgm is True:
                    music.music_play('./musics/sports-Ahjay_Stelino.mp3')
                else:
                    music.music_stop()

            elif key == "1":
                music.sound_play('./sounds/talk1.wav')
                sleep(0.05)
                music.sound_play('./sounds/talk3.wav')
                sleep(0.05)
                music.sound_play('./sounds/sign.wav')
                sleep(0.5)

            elif key =="2":
                music.sound_play_threading('./sounds/talk1.wav')
                sleep(0.05)
                music.sound_play_threading('./sounds/talk3.wav')
                sleep(0.05)
                music.sound_play_threading('./sounds/sign.wav')
                sleep(0.5)

            elif key == "t":
                words = "Hello"
                tts.say(words)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()


**How it works?**

Functions related to background music include these:

* ``music = Music()`` : Declare the object.
* ``music.music_set_volume(20)`` : Set the volume, the range is 0~100.
* ``music.music_play(./musics/sports-Ahjay_Stelino.mp3)`` : Play music files, here is the **sports-Ahjay_Stelino.mp3** file under the ``./musics`` path.
* ``music.music_stop()`` : Stop playing background music.

.. note::

    You can add different sound effects or music to ``musics`` or ``sounds`` folder via :ref:`filezilla`.


Functions related to sound effects include these:

* ``music = Music()``
* ``music.sound_play('./sounds/talk1.wav')``: Play the sound effect file, here is the **talk1.wav** file under the ``./musics`` path.
* ``music.sound_play_threading('./sounds/talk1.wav')``: Play the sound effect file in a new thread mode without suspending the main thread.

Functions related to Text to Speech include these:

* ``tts = TTS()``
* ``tts.say(words)`` : Text audio.
* ``tts.lang("en-US")`` :  Set the language.

.. note:: 

    Set the language by setting the parameters of ``lang("")`` with the following characters.
