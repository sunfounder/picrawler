==============================================

You need to check whether there are missing or damaged components according to the list first. If there are any problems, please contact us and we will solve them as soon as possible.

Please follow the steps on the PDF to assemble.

If the servo has been powered on, please do not turn the Servo shaft to avoid damage.


.. note::

    #. Before assembling, you need to buy 2 18650 batteries and fully charge them, refer to :ref:`About the Battery`.
    #. Robot HAT cannot charge the battery, so you need to buy a battery charger at the same time.
