Play with Ezblock
===========================

.. note::

    If you are using a Raspberry Pi 5, our graphical programming software, EzBlock, is not supported.

For beginners and novices, EzBlock is a software development platform offered by SunFounder for Raspberry Pi. Ezbock offers two programming environments: a graphical environment and a Python environment.

It is available for almost all types of devices, including Mac, PC, and Android.

Here is a tutorial to help you complete EzBlock installation, download, and use.

**Projects**

Here, we show you the projects of playing PiCrawler on Ezblock Studio. If you are new to these, you can refer to the code images inside each project to program, and can learn the use of blocks according to TIPS.

If you don't want to write these projects one by one, we have uploaded them to Ezblock Studio's Examples page and you can run them directly or edit them and run them later.
