An MCU is on board to extend the PWM output and ADC input for the Raspberry Pi, as well as a motor driver chip, Bluetooth module, I2S audio module and mono speaker. As well as the GPIOs that lead out of the Raspberry Pi itself.

It also comes with a Speaker, which can be used to play background music, sound effects and implement TTS functions to make your project more interesting.

Accepts 7-12V PH2.0 2pin power input with 2 power indicators. The board also has a user available LED and a button for you to quickly test some effects.
