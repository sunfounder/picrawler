Robot HAT
==================

|link_robot_hat_v4| is a multifunctional expansion board that allows Raspberry Pi to be quickly turned into a robot. 
An MCU is on board to extend the PWM output and ADC input for the Raspberry Pi, 
as well as a motor driver chip, I2S audio module and mono speaker. 
As well as the GPIOs that lead out of the Raspberry Pi itself.

It also comes with a Speaker, 
which can be used to play background music, sound effects and implement TTS functions to make your project more interesting.

Accepts 7-12V power input with 2 battery indicators, 1 charge indicator and 1 power indicator. 
The board also has a user available LED and a button for you to quickly test some effects.
