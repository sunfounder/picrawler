PiCrawler is a Raspberry Pi–based quadruped robot with an aluminum alloy structure.  
It features a camera module for color recognition and face detection, 12 metal-gear servos for walking and dynamic movements, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and a Robot HAT with a built-in speaker for expressive sound effects.

This documentation includes the parts list, assembly guide, Robot HAT introduction, and PiCrawler programming tutorials.

Programming is divided into two chapters:

* :ref:`play_ezblock`: Use Ezblock Studio for graphical programming.
* :ref:`play_python`: More experienced users can program PiCrawler directly using Python.
